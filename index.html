    <h1>What you need</h1>
    <p>To start, you'll need a computer of any kind that can handle 
        writing code. Next, you'll need to download a text editor. The best one is 
        vscode. After that, you should make a folder that will have all of you
        images in it. Then, you want to right click when in the folder to Create
        "index.html" and "style.css". Lastly, you put that into your text editor
        and start coding!
    </p>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="Requirements-col">
            <h3>Starting</h3>
            <p>To start off, you want to click onto the index.html 
                and start with adding the "<!doctype html>." If you 
                using a text editor that might already have the finished,
                 start, that justs makes it easier on you and you don't have
                to do anything. However, if you don't, don't worry, 
                as you can just search up and copy and paste the 
                beginning.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="Requirements-col">
            <h3>The Hard Part</h3>
            <p>Although this might be intimidating, don't worry. 
                Isn't difficult to code. All you have to do is 
                go on youtube and search up "how to code a website."
                Just follow that tutorial, and try to spice some things 
                up so that you could start learning a bit.
            </p>

        <div class="Requirements-col">
            <h3>Glory
            </h3>
            <p>At the end, once you've finished you are victorious.
                Unless you want to publish your website. For that you'll 
                need to buy a domain, go to google sites, and publish 
                your website to google. Now, you are truly glorious.
